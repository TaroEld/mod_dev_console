# Console

The console is opened by default with ctrl+g. It starts in a small window, and can be toggled to be larger with another press of ctrl+g, and is then closed the same way.
In this console, you can insert commands in either squirrel or javascript. It defaults to squirrel, and can be switched to javascript by pressing the 'Squirrel' button in the footer.
